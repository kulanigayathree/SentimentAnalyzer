# 🌟 Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression

A beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts whether a given text is **Positive** or **Negative**.  
This project demonstrates an **end-to-end ML workflow**: data creation, preprocessing, vectorization, model training, testing, and prediction.  
Now enhanced with a **Streamlit app** to make predictions interactively.

## 🎯 Results

- Small dataset → simple yet clear model  
- Accuracy may vary depending on test split  
- Works perfectly for **demo purposes** and beginner ML learning

---

## 🌱 Future Improvements

- Extend the project with a **larger real-world dataset**  
- Try other models like **Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest**  
- Deploy the model online using **Streamlit Cloud**  
- Add **data visualization** for sentiment trends and analysis
