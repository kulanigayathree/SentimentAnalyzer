## 🌟 Sentiment Analysis Using Logistic Regression

A simple and beginner-friendly Machine Learning project that predicts whether a given text is Positive or Negative.
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow: data creation, preprocessing, vectorization, model training, testing, and prediction.

## 🚀 Project Features

Clean, beginner-friendly dataset

TF-IDF used to convert text into numerical vectors

Logistic Regression model for classification

Accuracy evaluation using test data

Ability to predict sentiment for any custom sentence

Entire project implemented inside a single Jupyter Notebook

## 📦 Technologies Used

| Tool / Library        | Purpose                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Python**            | Main programming language    |
| **Pandas**            | Data handling & preprocessing|
| **Scikit-Learn**      | Machine Learning algorithms  |
| **TfidfVectorizer**   | Convert text → numerical form|
